# Ajax-using-Dajgno-with-Preloader

Performing Django form request using Ajax calls to make asynchronous.

Using **Jquery** for Ajax calls.
Basically in this project I created **Two Input Fields** and **One Button** withour using any **Form**. After clicking(**OnClick Function**) on button Ajax request will executed.

Also by the time **POST** request will served it will show **Loader**.
