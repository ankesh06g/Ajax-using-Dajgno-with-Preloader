# Ajax-with-Dajgno

Performing Django form request using Ajax calls to make asynchronous.

In this project I'm using **Jquery** for Ajax calls, you can use javascript too.
Basically I created **Two Input Fields** and **One Button** without using **Form**. So, **OnClick** funtion on Button it will take values of Input Fiels and submit **POST** request to Django URL.
After that on Success it will set value to output.
